<h1>â€“<h6>: The HTML Section Heading elements

The <h1> to <h6> HTML elements represent six levels of section headings. <h1> is the highest section level and <h6> is the lowest. 

By default, all heading elements create a block-level box in the layout, starting on a new line and taking up the full width available in their containing block.
