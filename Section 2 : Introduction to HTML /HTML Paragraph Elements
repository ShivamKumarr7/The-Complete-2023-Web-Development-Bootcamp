<p>: The Paragraph element

The <p> HTML element represents a paragraph.
 Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines 

Paragraphs are block-level elements, and notably will automatically close if another block-level element is parsed before the closing </p> tag.
